## Procedure for the experiment is as follows:

(a) Pour the prepared potassium ferricyanide solution in the electro chemical cell .<br>

(b) Immerse the electrodes(Ag|Agcl) ref Pt asworking & carbon as counter electrode.<br>

(c) Open Nova|| interface & feed the potential range in the window.<br>

(d) Analyse the CV plot.<br>

(a) Deoxygeante the buffer solution which is to be used in the experiment.<br>

(b) Clean the electrode carefully before performing experiment.<br>

(c) Assemble the cell in deoxygenated solution.<br>

(e) After performing the experiment dispose solution in specified waste container.<br>
