### Procedure:
Requirements 
Potassium ferricyanide, volumetric flasks, beaker, working (GCE/Pt/Au), reference (Ag/AgCl), and counter (Pt wire) electrode.
### The procedure for the experiment is as follows:
1.	Prepare the solution by weighing 0.32 g of potassium ferricyanide.<br>
2.	Transfer it to a 100ml volumetric flask, and make up with distilled water.<br>
3.	Pour the prepared potassium ferricyanide solution into the electrochemical cell.<br>
4.	Deoxygenate the solution by purging with N₂/Ar gas for 8–12 min in a fume hood to remove dissolved oxygen that interferes with CV.<br>
5.	Clean the electrode carefully before performing the experiment.<br>
6.	Immense the reference electrode(Ag/AgCl), counter electrode(Pt wire), and working electrode(GCE/Pt/Au) into the deoxygenated solution.<br>
7.	Open NOVA 1.11 interface & feed the potential range in the window.<br>
8.	Run the CV scan and record the voltammogram.<br>
9.	After performing the experiment, dispose solution in the specified waste container.<br>
