### Requirements :
●	Potentiostat/Galvanostat with CV mode and data acquisition software.<br>

●	Three–electrode setup: Working electrode (GCE/Pt), Reference (Ag/AgCl/SCE), Counter (Pt wire/mesh). <br>

●	Chemicals: K₃[Fe(CN)₆], K₄[Fe(CN)₆], KCl (supporting electrolyte), DI water. <br>

●	Glassware: Volumetric flasks, beakers, pipettes, analytical balance. <br>

●	Electrochemical cell for measurement. <br>
###CV parameters:
 Initial potential: 0.0 V • Final potential: +0.6 V • Scan rate: 50–100 mV/s • Quiet time: 5–10 s

## Procedure for the experiment is as follows:
1.	Prepare potassium ferri/ferrocyanide electrolyte and transfer it to the electrochemical cell.<br>

2.	Clean/activate the working electrode (polish, rinse, sonicate if required).<br>

3.	Deoxygenate the solution by purging with N₂/Ar for 8–12 min in a fume hood to remove dissolved oxygen that interferes with CV.<br>

4.	Insert electrodes (Ag/AgCl reference, Pt counter, GCE/Pt/Au working) into the deoxygenated solution without them touching.<br>

5.	Open NOVA 1.11 → set CV parameters (initial 0.0 V, final 0.6 V, scan rate 50–100 mV/s, quiet time 5 s, cycles 2–3).<br>

6.	Run the CV scan and record the voltammogram.<br>

7.	After completion, wash electrodes and dispose electrolyte in the designated waste container.<br>
