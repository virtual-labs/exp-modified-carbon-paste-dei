### Cyclic Voltammetry:

It is an electrochemical technique which is used to study the oxidation and reduction reactions of molecular species. It is also useful in depicting 
electron transfer in catalysis reactions. It measures the amount of current (I) with respect to varying potential (V).
Voltammogram: It is defined as a plot observed between the charge in current with the varying voltage. For an electrode, minimum potential is required to 
initiate reduction or oxidation reaction.
