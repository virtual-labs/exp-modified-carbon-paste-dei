## Procedure for the experiment is as follows:

(a) Pour the prepared potassium ferricyanide solution in the electrochemical cell .<br>

(b) Immense the reference electrode(Ag/AgCl), counter electrode(Pt wire) and working electrode(GCE/Pt/Au).<br>

(c) Open NOVA 1.11 interface & feed the potential range in the window.<br>

(d) Analyse the CV plot.<br>

(a) Deoxygeante the buffer solution which is to be used in the experiment.<br>

(b) Clean the electrode carefully before performing experiment.<br>

(c) Assemble the cell in deoxygenated solution.<br>

(e) After performing the experiment dispose solution in specified waste container.<br>
